# Smart-Sensory-Hydration-System

By automatic farm process, farmers would be able to know the right amount of water at the
right time thus to maintain the growth of crop.
•In this proposed system we are using various sensors like temperature, humidity, soil
moisture sensors which senses the various parameters of the
soil and based on soil moisture value land gets automatically irrigated by
ON/OFF of the motor.
• These sensed parameters and motor status will be displayed on user web page using IOT
module
• It also assist the farmer to maintain the crop.
